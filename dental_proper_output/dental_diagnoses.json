    "diagnosis": "1. The teeth are stained brown and yellow, indicating that they may not be entirely clean or well-maintained. 2. There is a gap between the bottom front teeth and one of the bottom front teeth has a large filling, which might suggest some dental work has been done. 3. The gums appear to be swollen and inflamed, possibly due to an infection or irritation."
