    "care_suggestions": "I'm unable to view images, but I can offer general advice for maintaining good dental hygiene based on common needs.\n\n1. **Brushing Technique Recommendations:**\n   - Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and a fluoride toothpaste.\n   - Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums.\n   - Use gentle, short strokes, covering each tooth's surface (outer, inner, and chewing surfaces).\n   - Brush for at least 2 minutes, twice a day.\n   - Consider using an electric toothbrush for more effective cleaning.\n\n2. **Flossing Tips:**\n   - Use a gentle sawing motion to guide the floss between the teeth.\n   - Curve the floss around each tooth and slide it up and down against the tooth surface and under the gum line.\n   - If you have tight contacts between teeth, waxed floss might be easier to use.\n   - For wider gaps, interdental brushes may be more effective.\n\n3. **Recommended Oral Care Products:**\n   - Use fluoride toothpaste to help strengthen enamel.\n   - A therapeutic mouthwash that helps reduce plaque and fight gingivitis can be beneficial.\n   - Consider products with the ADA Seal of Acceptance for quality assurance.\n\n4. **Dietary Suggestions for Better Dental Health:**\n   - Limit sugary and acidic foods and drinks to prevent enamel erosion and cavities.\n   - Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and dairy products for balanced nutrition.\n   - Drink water after meals to help wash away food particles and bacteria.\n\n5. **Frequency and Timing of Dental Care Routines:**\n   - Brush twice a day (morning and night) and floss at least once a day.\n   - Rinse with mouthwash once daily, preferably at a different time than brushing to allow fluoride from toothpaste to stay on teeth longer.\n   - Regular dental check-ups every six months or as recommended by your dentist are crucial for maintaining oral health.\n\nImplement these habits consistently for optimal dental health.",

    "care_suggestions": "I'm unable to view images, so I can offer general dental care advice. However, here are some preventive and daily habits for maintaining good oral hygiene:\n\n### 1. Brushing Technique\n- **Technique**: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and brush gently at a 45-degree angle to the gums. Use short, circular strokes.\n- **Duration**: Brush for at least two minutes, twice a day.\n- **Areas**: Make sure to clean all surfaces, including inner and outer surfaces, chewing surfaces, and tongue.\n\n### 2. Flossing Tips\n- **Spacing**: Use waxed floss if you have closely spaced teeth; unwaxed floss for normal spacing.\n- **Technique**: Gently slide the floss between teeth and curve it into a C-shape against each tooth, going below the gum line.\n- **Frequency**: Floss once a day, ideally before bedtime.\n\n### 3. Recommended Oral Care Products\n- **Toothpaste**: Use toothpaste with fluoride and consider using one with tartar control or sensitivity protection if needed.\n- **Mouthwash**: Opt for an antibacterial mouthwash to reduce plaque and gingivitis. Alcohol-free formulas are gentler on the mouth.\n\n### 4. Dietary Suggestions\n- **Limit Sugars**: Reduce sugary snacks and beverages to prevent cavities.\n- **Eat Crunchy Fruits/Vegetables**: Apples, carrots, and celery help clean teeth naturally.\n- **Calcium-Rich Foods**: Include dairy products or fortified alternatives to maintain strong teeth.\n\n### 5. Frequency and Timing\n- **Brushing**: Twice daily, ideally in the morning and before bed.\n- **Flossing**: Once daily.\n- **Mouthwash**: Use once daily, after brushing and flossing, for best results.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you help protect your oral health and prevent problems like cavities and gum disease.

    "care_suggestions": "Based on the presence of braces, here are some personalized dental care suggestions:\n\n### 1. Brushing Technique Recommendations\n- **Use an Orthodontic Toothbrush:** Opt for a soft-bristled brush specifically designed for braces. \n- **Angle the Brush:** Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to clean around the brackets and wires. Make sure to brush above and below the braces thoroughly.\n- **Brush Time:** Brush for at least two minutes, focusing on all surfaces of the teeth, braces, and gums.\n\n### 2. Flossing Tips\n- **Use Floss Threaders:** These help thread dental floss behind each wire, allowing you to clean between the teeth and along the gumline.\n- **Consider Water Flossers:** A water flosser can be effective in removing debris between teeth and around brackets.\n- **Be Gentle:** Take care not to snap the floss on the gumline to avoid irritation.\n\n### 3. Recommended Oral Care Products\n- **Fluoride Toothpaste:** Use a fluoride toothpaste to help strengthen enamel and prevent cavities.\n- **Antimicrobial Mouthwash:** Choose a mouthwash that fights plaque and gingivitis. Make sure it's alcohol-free to avoid drying out your mouth.\n- **Orthodontic Wax:** Use this to cover any hardware that may cause irritation to your inner cheeks.\n\n### 4. Dietary Suggestions for Better Dental Health\n- **Avoid Sticky and Hard Foods:** Steer clear of gum, caramels, and hard candies that can damage braces.\n- **Limit Sugary Snacks:** Reduce intake of sugary foods and drinks to minimize the risk of cavities.\n- **Eat a Balanced Diet:** Include plenty of calcium-rich foods like dairy, leafy greens, and almonds to support tooth health.\n\n### 5. Frequency and Timing of Dental Care Routines\n- **Brush After Every Meal:** Due to the increased risk of food particles getting stuck, it's important to brush after every meal.\n- **Floss",

    "care_suggestions": "I'm unable to view or analyze images, but I can provide general dental care recommendations for someone with braces:\n\n### 1. Brushing Technique\n- **Tool**: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush or an electric toothbrush with an orthodontic head.\n- **Angle**: Hold the toothbrush at a 45-degree angle to the gum line.\n- **Method**: Brush above and below the brackets. Use small circular motions for about two minutes. Brush each tooth individually to ensure thorough cleaning.\n- **Frequency**: Brush after each meal to prevent plaque buildup around the braces.\n\n### 2. Flossing Tips\n- **Tool**: Use a floss threader or orthodontic floss for easier access under the wire.\n- **Technique**: Gently slide the floss between the teeth and under the gum line. Use a gentle back-and-forth motion to clean the sides of each tooth.\n- **Alternative**: Consider using an interdental brush or water flosser for areas that are difficult to reach.\n\n### 3. Recommended Oral Care Products\n- **Toothpaste**: Use fluoride toothpaste to help strengthen enamel and prevent decay.\n- **Mouthwash**: A fluoride mouthwash can provide additional protection against cavities.\n- **Wax**: Orthodontic wax can be used to cover any sharp bracket edges that irritate the mouth.\n\n### 4. Dietary Suggestions\n- **Avoid**: Sticky, hard, or chewy foods that might damage the brackets or wires (e.g., caramel, popcorn, nuts).\n- **Focus On**: Eating soft fruits and vegetables. Cut them into smaller pieces to avoid pressure on the braces.\n- **Drink water**: Stay hydrated and rinse your mouth with water after eating, especially if brushing isn't possible immediately.\n\n### 5. Frequency and Timing of Dental Care Routines\n- **Morning and Night**: Brush teeth thoroughly.\n- **After Meals**: Quick brush or at least rinse with water.\n- **",
