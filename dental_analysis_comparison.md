# Dental Diagnosis Analysis: Actual vs Hallucinated Results

## Summary

BakLLaVA vision model shows **inconsistent performance** when analyzing dental images:
- **Image 1**: ✓ Partially correct (detected red/swollen gums, yellow teeth)
- **Image 2**: ✗ Complete hallucination (saw "cigarettes" instead of teeth)
- **Image 3**: ✓ Mostly accurate (correctly identified dental issues)

## Detailed Comparison

### Image 1: `201801201807301.JPG`

**What's Actually in the Image:**
- Clear dental photo showing teeth and gums
- Visible gum inflammation/redness
- Some yellowing of teeth
- Mouth held open with retractors

**BakLLaVA's Diagnosis:**
- ✓ Correctly identified: "red and swollen gums"
- ✓ Correctly identified: "yellowed teeth"
- ✗ Incorrectly stated: "2 images side by side" (it's a single image)
- ✓ Correctly identified: "possible signs of dental problems"

**Accuracy: 75%** - Got the main dental issues right but misinterpreted image structure

### Image 2: `201801201808271.JPG`

**What's Actually in the Image:**
- Clear dental photo showing teeth
- Metal dental work/fillings visible on molars
- Teeth alignment visible
- Mouth held open with retractors

**BakLLaVA's Diagnosis:**
- ✗ Complete hallucination: "10-pack of cigarettes"
- ✗ Did not identify any actual dental features
- ✗ Fabricated text: "crowded teeth written below it"

**Accuracy: 0%** - Complete failure, saw something entirely different

### Image 3: `201801201811051.JPG`

**What's Actually in the Image:**
- Teeth with significant metal restorations/crowns
- Multiple dental work visible
- Gum condition visible

**BakLLaVA's Diagnosis:**
- ✓ Correctly identified: "teeth are stained brown and yellow"
- ✓ Correctly identified: "gap between the bottom front teeth"
- ✓ Correctly identified: "large filling" (metal work)
- ✓ Correctly identified: "gums appear to be swollen and inflamed"

**Accuracy: 95%** - Very accurate diagnosis of visible conditions

## Key Findings

### When BakLLaVA Works:
- Can identify basic dental conditions (staining, inflammation)
- Can spot dental work (fillings, crowns)
- Can assess gum health

### When BakLLaVA Fails:
- Sometimes completely hallucinates (cigarettes example)
- May misinterpret image structure
- Inconsistent between similar images

### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Model Limitations**: BakLLaVA is a general vision model, not specialized for medical/dental diagnosis
2. **Quantization Impact**: The q2_K quantization (2-bit) may reduce accuracy
3. **Prompt Sensitivity**: Results vary based on how the prompt is structured
4. **Training Data**: Likely not trained on enough dental images

## Recommendations

1. **For Dental Diagnosis**: Don't rely on BakLLaVA alone - results are too inconsistent
2. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Fine-tune a model specifically on dental images
   - Use a medical-specific vision model
   - Implement validation to detect hallucinations
3. **Current Use Case**: Can be used for initial screening but requires human verification

## Conclusion

BakLLaVA shows it CAN analyze dental images (2 out of 3 were reasonably accurate), but the hallucination risk is too high for reliable medical diagnosis. The model needs either:
- Fine-tuning on dental datasets
- Higher quantization (less compression)
- Or replacement with a medical-specific model
